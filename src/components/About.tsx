                SeeIT empowers AI developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to peer deeply 
                into their large language models (LLMs). Using advanced visualization and mapper-driven 
                explanations inspired by cutting-edge research, SeeIT transforms complex LLM embedding spaces 
                into interactive maps that reveal hidden semantic clusters, relationships, and pathways.
